> I started to code in 6th grade. I learned JavaScript and HTML, but I haven't coded since.
> My reasons for taking this class are that I was to re-learn how to code and explore other languages.
> My other interests are in robotics and engineering. 
> My goals for this class are to learn how to code better and improve my skills and get a good grade for this class.
